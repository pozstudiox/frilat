      <h4 class="mb-3 text-primary">Your Privacy, Your Rights!</h4>
      <p>
        Welcome to <b>FriLat</b>. We know: on the internet, privacy isn’t just a legal checkbox—it’s trust. That’s why at FriLat, your privacy is not for sale, not for trade, and never an afterthought.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page explains, in simple language, what data we collect, why, and—most importantly—how we protect it. <b>You always stay in control.</b>
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-3 text-primary">What Information Do We Collect?</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Account Data:</b> When you sign up, we ask for a username, email, and password. That’s it. No phone numbers, no ID scans, no “big brother”.</li>
        <li><b>Profile Details:</b> You can add a name, bio, or website to share with the community. Or keep it blank—your call.</li>
        <li><b>Uploads:</b> Files you upload are stored securely, never shared with third parties, and can be deleted by you at any time.</li>
        <li><b>Basic Usage Data:</b> We log some anonymous info (device/browser type, general region) to keep FriLat fast, secure, and bug-free.</li>
        <li><b>Cookies:</b> Only the minimum for login/session. No advertising or tracking cookies. Ever.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 text-primary">How Do We Use Your Data?</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><b>For You, Not for Sale:</b> We use your data to deliver features you want—like uploads, albums, and personal settings. Your data is <u>never</u> sold, rented, or shared with advertisers.</li>
        <li><b>Security:</b> Passwords are encrypted using state-of-the-art methods. Even we can’t see them. File downloads are protected by random links, not guessable by anyone else.</li>
        <li><b>Improvement:</b> Anonymous stats help us spot errors, improve speed, and deliver better features. No tracking, just tech upgrades!</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 text-primary">Your Controls & Privacy Tools</h5>
      <ul>

            <li>Private accounts hide your uploads and personal info from everyone except you.</li>
            <li>When in “Private” mode, only your avatar, username, and (optionally) bio/website are public.</li>

        </li>

      <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2 text-primary">How Are My Uploads Protected?</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Unique download links:</b> Every file gets a random, private download link—only you can share it.</li>
        <li><b>File deletion:</b> Delete uploads instantly from your dashboard. We scrub them from our servers—no backup copies.</li>
        <li><b>Short-Lived Uploads:</b> For extra privacy, you can upload files set to auto-delete after a chosen period (5 or 10 minutes).</li>
      </ul>
